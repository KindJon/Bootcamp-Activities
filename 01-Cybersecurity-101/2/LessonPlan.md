### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Overview  (0:15)

Welcome students to class. Begin with a review of the previous class:

- We introduced students to the structure of the course and the staff who will support them. We also covered the rise of cybersecurity, the boot camp's course overview, and the technical infrastructures we will use to complete labs. Finally, we introduced the fundamental cybersecurity concept of the CIA triad. 

Using the slideshow, briefly review threat assessment and risk mitigation, and the CIA triad. 

- Briefly discuss how cybersecurity focuses on two primary concepts:

  - **Threat assessment:** The structured process of identifying the threats posed to a group or system.

  - **Risk mitigation:** The systematic reduction of the impact and likely occurrence of a negative event.

:question: **Ask class:** Why do we use the word "mitigation" and not "eradication"? 

- **Answer:** Point out that we cannot eradicate all risks. Since cybersecurity is an ever-evolving landscape, new threats emerge every day. Also, business needs and budgetary constraints often limit the ability to implement cybersecurity best practices. So we must do our best to mitigate.



### 02. Instructor Do: Introducing Security Task #1 - The Stolen IPhone (0:07)

Explain that we will dive right into our first activity to understand the "security mindset"

Using the slides, explain the scenario to students: 

- You just found an unattended Iphone left at the table in a restaurant.

- The phone is not locked with a password, and every feature and app is accessible.

In groups, develop a list of 5–10 ways that a malicious actor could maliciously use this phone.
- Think creatively.

- Think like a malicious actor.

- Point out that not all malicious acts are technical.

### 03. Student Do: Security Task #1 - The Stolen IPhone (0:20)

:globe_with_meridians: Assign students into groups of 3–4 and move them into breakout rooms. 

Send them the following activity file: 

- [Activity File: Security Task #1 - The Stolen Iphone](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cybersecurity-v2/tree/v3.0-curriculum/v3.0-Curriculum/1-Lesson-Plans/01-Cybersecurity-101/2/Activities/02_The_Stolen_Iphone/Unsolved)

As students are working on this experiment, you and your TAs should monitor each group's progress. Where appropriate, nudge them to think more critically. For instance:

- If students seem to have run out of ideas, encourage them to think about non-technical attacks such as social engineering.

- If students seem to have come up with a full list, ask them to share their ideas. Challenge them if the ideas seem too similar. Remind them that they need to *think* like a cybercriminal. 

### 04.  Instructor Review: Security Task #1 - The Stolen IPhone (0:20)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

Ask a few student groups to share some of their ideas. Have a TA keep track of a running list of suggestions. 

- As groups name specific methods and strategies, you can ask the class, "Who else thought of that method?" and students can use Zoom's **Raise Hand** feature to indicate if they did.

Summarize that this activity had several purposes:
- To practice creative thinking.

- To understand that thinking like a cyber criminal, can help cyber professionals determine mitigation methods.

- To determine different types of potential vulnerabilities.

- Explain that these all make up the **security mindset**

Ask the class if they have any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 05. Instructor Do: Introducing Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall (0:07)

Explain that we will now work on two security tasks related to assessing threats and mitigating risks. 

In this next activity, we will continue to use the security mindset, but focus on technical systems which are common with many organizations.

  - We will examine various **attack** strategies that cybercriminals can use to penetrate insecure logins. 

- This exercise should force them to think creatively about all the ways to penetrate a system, from user attacks to physical break-ins. 

- To successfully complete this exercise, students must think through creative options. Students will experience a real sense of accomplishment when they discover real-world attack types through discussion and brainstorming. 

Using the slides, explain the scenario to students: 

- You and your team have just been hired by a very successful startup, Bitcoin Dating Exchange. 

- While their founding team is brilliant, like many startups, they don’t know the first thing about security.

- They have just handed you a lot of money to solve their most critical problem: their log-in process is totally insecure. Malicious attackers are routinely logging in as users (and administrators) and gaining access to company data and financial assets.

In groups, develop a list of 15 ways that a malicious actor could penetrate the system and log in as a user or administrator.

- With each method, be prepared to describe the following:

  - Who (or what) is the initial target?

  - How would the actor implement the attack?

### 06. Student Do: Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall (0:20)

:globe_with_meridians: Assign students into groups of 3–4 and move them into breakout rooms. 

Send them the following activity file: 

- [Activity File: Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall](Activities/03_Attacking_The_Wall/Unsolved/Readme.md)

As students are working on this experiment, you and your TAs should monitor each group's progress. Where appropriate, nudge them to think more critically. For instance:

- If students seem to have run out of ideas, encourage them to think about vulnerabilities to **other** aspects of the system. Have they considered the potential for theft? Have they considered the potential for a break-in? Have they considered that a person's password may be listed on another website?

- If students seem to have come up with a full list, ask them to share their ideas. Challenge them if the ideas seem too similar. Remind them that they need to *think* like a cybercriminal. Remind them that if one defense mechanism can block all their attacks at once, the cybercriminal will need to think of other pathways.

### 07.  Instructor Review: Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall (0:20)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

Ask a few student groups to share some of their ideas. Have a TA keep track of a running list of suggestions. 

- As groups name specific methods and strategies, you can ask the class, "Who else thought of that method?" and students can use Zoom's **Raise Hand** feature to indicate if they did.

- Once you've heard from a few groups, go to the set of slides that begin with the title card **Step #1: Assess the Target**, which break down our approach to solving the problem. Then review specific attacks starting at the title card **Step #2: Define Attack Strategies**. 
  
  - The slides provide a list of 15 different ways of attacking the system. While some are more technical than others, try not to get too deep into the details. These slides are meant to provide students with ideas. They are not meant to be a full lesson on attack strategy.

  - Where appropriate, ask students for examples.
  
  - If you have stories from your professional experience that are relevant to the slides, please share!

  - When covering the slide Attack Option 3, have students quickly visit haveibeenpwned.com to see whether any of their accounts have been compromised in a data breach.
  
  - When covering the slide Attack Option 4, refer back to the USB scenario from the previous day to reinforce the concept. 

Ask if students have any question so far. 

Explain that now that we have evaluated all the threats posed to this company, we will consider how to mitigate the risks.   

### 08. Student Do: Security Task #3 - Defending the Wall (0:20)

In the same groups, students will now use their list of potential attacks from the previous activity to develop a list of at least 10 strategies to mitigate the website's risk. 

- The goal of this exercise is for students to realize that they can use certain mitigation strategies to handle multiple threats at once.

- Students should arrive at 10 or more strategies total that address the concerns.

:globe_with_meridians: Students should stay in the same breakout room groups as the previous activity. 

Send students the following activity file: 

- [Activity File: Security Task #3 - Defending the Wall](Activities/05_Defending_the_Wall/Unsolved/Readme.md)

### 09.  Instructor Review: Security Task #3 - Defending the Wall (0:15)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

- It may be interesting to poll the class and ask who preferred attacking and who preferred defending.

Ask a few groups to share some of their mitigation strategies. 

- As groups share their specific methods and strategies, you can ask the class, "Who else thought of that method?" and students can use Zoom's **Raise Hand** feature to indicate if they did.

Then, review the official solutions by using the slides, starting at title card **Step Three: Risk Mitigation Plan**. 

- A key takeaway to share with students is that effective risk mitigation strategies can address multiple threats at once. 

Ask if students have any questions.


### 10. Instructor and TAs Do: Fireside Chat

For the remainder of class, spend some time discussing the ways in which you all entered into the industry. Let students ask questions and build up their confidence as best as you can.

- Feel free to adjust the chat as you see fit, but below are some suggested questions:

  - What tips would you give the students to succeeed in the next 24 weeks?
  - What is your formal title and what do you actually do all day?
  - What were your first cybersecurity jobs?
  - It can be hard to get your first opportunity in the field? How does someone prove that they have the skills and that they know what it takes and have the knowledge? (I.e. web and data science candidates can use portfolios; how do we do that with cyber?)
  - A lot of folks are transitioning into a new field. What advice do you have for people to bridge their past experiences to what they want to do in cybersecurity?
  - What are the most important skills you can learn in your first cybersecurity job?
  - When hiring, what do you look for in candidates?
  - How do you see this space changing in the next 1-3 years? Next 5 years?
